This folder contains snippets, including code out of context from several academic assignments. Due to the nature of the academic assignments, the full code used to complete the assignments (and to compile the code) is not shown. This is to prevent current (and future) students from being able to copy this work.

Some attempt at commenting was made. The following a is a list of these files, and their relevance:

**add.c** - various algorithms used to sum an array of numbers, including sequential summation, sorted (ascending order) summation, summation of two minimum values, and (the focus of the assignment) using a heap

**heap.c** - a basic heap implementation

**map_route.c** - a (crude) example of Djikstra's algorithm

**qsort.c** - simple quicksort implementation

**queue.c** - very simple queue structure (used in various assignments)

**rbt.c** - Red/Black tree implementation, used in the context of finding disk locations (focus of assignment)

**sort-ints.c** - various sorting algorithms including counting, radix, quick, insertion (system quick sort is stdlib quick sort)

**tsort.c** - out of context depth first search (DFS) to impelement topological search

**union.c** - implementation of union-find data structure
